# Google Sales-Training-After-Action-Review

## Overview
Led the design and execution of a flagship global Sales Compliance Certification program for Google Cloud, addressing inconsistent adoption of deal execution tools (Salesforce, SIMBA, CPQ, DocuSign) and compliance selling principles across Sales and Support teams.

## Key Results
* **15,200+** global learners enrolled, with a 94% completion rate and 90% learner satisfaction.
* Drove measurable business impact:
  * 17% reduction in deal closure delays (QoQ).
  * 8% drop in concession offerings.
  * 3% decrease in compliance control breaches.
  * 5 high-risk deals flagged pre-quarter close, reducing audit and revenue risk.
* Strengthened cross-functional alignment across Compliance, Finance, GTM Operations, and Sales.

## Learning Experience Design
* Developed interactive modules combining compliance fundamentals, system adoption workflows, and customer conversation simulations.
* Embedded real-world scenarios, Salesforce/SIMBA demos, and knowledge checkpoints for applied learning.
* Introduced microlearning, automated reminders, and persona-based use cases to drive continuous adoption.

## Insights & Next Steps
* Earlier alignment with Product Marketing and Revenue Recognition stakeholders enhances content relevance.
* Plan to expand enrollment to additional GTM functions and integrate generative AI microlearning support (e.g., Writer AI guidance in Salesforce/CPQ).
* Future focus on embedding compliance enablement into onboarding and ongoing revenue programs.
